    <h2>What is this site?</h2>
    <p>I created this site to make your first step into coding easy. Here, you can find the best first languages to learn,
      access top courses to help you learn them, and find additional resources, like projects and articles
      about specific topics in coding. Before doing my own research on this, I spent too much time wondering whether
      the material I was learning was useful, employable, or relevant. I don’t want you to have to wonder that, which
      is why I’ve placed emphasis on finding learning material that will teach you languages and skills that transfer
      easily to real-world projects. I have also recommended resources with varying levels of price and commitment to
      allow you to decide exactly how deep you want to dive. <br><br>You could choose to read about important concepts without
      writing any code, you could take the basic coding classes I recommend and proceed with independent projects,
      you could gain coding certifications from well-known universities, or any combination of these. <span class="startEmph">How much</span>
       you choose to learn is entirely up to you, but I hope that by using my site, you will not have to figure out for yourself <span class="startEmph">how</span> to learn.
       <h2>Who am I?</h2>
       <p>I'm a student finishing my education at Grand Valley State University, pursuing a combined bachelor's in Information Systems and master's in Applied Computer Science.
         I've been coding since high school, and have been working as a software development intern since May 2020. I'm passionate about empowering people to <span class="startEmph">teach themselves new skills</span>,
         and I fully believe that regardless of background or current technical ability, <span class="startEmph">anyone can learn to code</span>. I hope that using this site will help you achieve that.</p>
