        <p>"What is <a href="https://www.edureka.co/blog/what-is-java/" target="_blank">Java</a>? Java is a cross-platform object-oriented programming language that was released by Sun Microsystems
          in the year 1995. Today, Java is needed to run various applications such as games, social media applications, audio and video applications, etc. It is highly popular and has dominated this field from early 2000’s till the present 2018.
          Some of the applications are listed below: <br> Banking &middot; Retail &middot; Information Technology &middot; Android &middot; Financial services &middot; Stock market &middot; Big Data &middot; Scientific and Research Community"</p>

        <p class="javaTopic"><img src="variable.png" class="javaTopicImg">"<a href="https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/variables" target="_blank">Variables</a> are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program.
          They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood
          more clearly by the reader and ourselves. It is helpful to think of variables as containers that
          hold information. Their sole purpose is to label and store data in memory. This data can then be used
          throughout your program."</p>
          <p class="javaTopic"><img src="if.png" class="javaTopicImg">In English, if statements are quite simple. If a condition is true, then do something.
            For example, if your shoes have a hole, then buy a new pair of shoes. If statements also usually have an
            ‘else.’ For example, If your shoes have a hole, buy a new pair of shoes. Otherwise (else), don’t. This
            structure is used very frequently in coding. Let’s say you try to log into your Facebook account. When
            you type in your password, it checks to see if it is the same as the password they have on file for you.
            If it is, you are logged in. If it is not, you are prompted to try again. In if statement syntax: if
            the password is correct, the user is logged in. Else, the user must try again.</p>
            <p class="javaTopic"><img src="for.png" class="javaTopicImg">"There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times.
              In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first,
              followed by the second, and so on. Programming languages provide various control structures that allow
              for more complicated execution paths. A <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_loop_control.htm" target="_blank">loop statement</a> allows
              us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times and following is the general form of a loop statement
              in most of the programming languages."</p>
            <p class="javaTopic"><img src="class.png" class="javaTopicImg">"Java is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is associated with
              <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_classes.asp" target="_blank">classes and objects</a>, along with its attributes and methods." <br> A class in
            essentially a blueprint used for creating something. An object is the thing you create from the blueprint. For example, you could have a blueprint for a house
          (a class), and when you build a house using the blueprints, that house is the object. Attributes are details about the house, like its color and size. Methods are things
          the house can do, like 'turn on heat', or 'close door.'</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/htmlcss#:~:text=HTML%20">"HTML</a> (the Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two of the core
          technologies for building Web pages. HTML provides the structure of the page, CSS the (visual and aural)
          layout, for a variety of devices." <br> "HTML is the language for describing the structure of Web pages. HTML gives authors the means to:
          <ul>
            <li>Publish online documents with headings, text, tables, lists, photos, etc.</li>
            <li>Retrieve online information via hypertext links, at the click of a button.</li>
            <li>Design forms for conducting transactions with remote services, for use in searching for information, making reservations, ordering products, etc.</li>
            <li>Include spread-sheets, video clips, sound clips, and other applications directly in their documents.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>With HTML, authors describe the structure of pages using markup. The elements of the language label pieces of content such as “paragraph,” “list,” “table,” and so on."</p>

        <div class="resourcesHolder">
        <p class="htmlTopic"><img src="tags.png" class="htmlTopicImg">The content that goes on a webpage is held inside pieces of code called
          <a href="https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/variables" target="_blank">tags</a>. The name of the tag indicates what it holds. For example, the
        'p' tag holds a paragraph, the 'h1' tag contains a heading, and the 'img' tag contains an image. All the content in a webpage is enclosed in tags of some kind.
      Check out <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/most-commonly-used-tags-in-html/">this article</a> to read about the various kinds of tags. Every time you use tags,
    you will have an opening tag and a closing tag, which sandwich the content the tags refer to. This can be seen in the example here.</p>
          <p class="htmlTopic"><img src="nested.png" class="htmlTopicImg">Tags can be "nested" - e.g. tags can go inside other tags, as seen in the picture here.
          This is done to accurately lay out the structure of the site. For example, say you have a section on the page with a heading and several paragraphs of text.
          Putting this content inside 'div' tags (which indicate, esssentially, a box that holds content) shows that they belong together and are distinct from other sections of the page.
          </p>
            <p class="htmlTopic"><img src="CSS.png" class="htmlTopicImg">"<a href="https://skillcrush.com/blog/css/" target="_blank">CSS</a> stands for Cascading Style Sheets with an emphasis placed on “Style.” While HTML is used
              to structure a web document (defining things like headlines and paragraphs, and allowing you to embed images, video, and other media), CSS comes through
              and specifies your document’s style—page layouts, colors, and fonts are all determined with CSS. Think of HTML as the foundation (every house has one), and
              CSS as the aesthetic choices (there’s a big difference between a Victorian mansion and a mid-century modern home)."<br>CSS is applied to HTML by writing
             code that refers to specific HTML tags. The code in the example turns the color of all text held within 'p' tags red.</p>

          language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more
          than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D
          graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved."</p>

        <div class="resourcesHolder">
        <p class="jsTopic"><img src="script.png" class="jsTopicImg">JavaScript shares some major concepts with Java, including variables, classes, objects, and functions.
        It works with HTML and CSS, and can be linked to your HTML page using the syntax shown here. All you need to do is place that line of code before the closing body tag
      in your HTML file, and replace the name of the file ("myScript.js") with whatever your JavaScript file is called. After that, the webpage will use the JavaScript code you write.</p>
          <p class="jsTopic">HTML events are interactions between a user and a website, for example, clicking a link or hovering over
            an image. You can use JavaScript to make things happen when events occur. Event listeners are what "listen" for these events happening, and event handlers are
              pieces of code that run when the event listener notices an event happening. Say you're working on a website, and you want an image to expand when a user clicks on it. The event
              is the user clicking on it, the event listener notices that they clicked on it, and the event handler is the code that makes the image expand. There are numerous kinds of
              events, including onclick (user clicking an HTML element), onmouseover (user mouses over an HTML element), and onchange (an HTML element has been changed).
