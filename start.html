    <h2>What is computer programming?</h2>
    <p>"Computer programming is a <span class="startEmph">way of giving computers instructions about what they should do next</span>.
      These instructions are known as code, and computer programmers write code to solve problems or
      perform tasks. <br> <br> The end goal is to create something: that could mean anything from a web page,
      or a piece of software, or even just a pretty picture. That’s why computer programming is often
      described as a <span class="startEmph">mix between art and science</span>; it’s technical and analytical, yet creative at the same
      time."

      <h2>Front-End vs. Back-End Development</h2>
      <p>"Front-end development involves working with code that produces the elements that users can see and interact with;
        it’s <span class="startEmph">all about how a website looks and feels</span>."  Start with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development.
        <br><br> "Back-end web developers <span class="startEmph">make sure the website works as it should do</span>,
        and the code they write is normally invisible to users. Back-end web developers work with databases that store information
        such as customer details, and servers which are where databases (virtually) live." I recommend Java as a good starting place.</p>
